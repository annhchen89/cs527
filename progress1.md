### Effort and Challenges
___
__Yong Han Lin (yonghan5)__
- I created 2 pull requests toward ```EsotericSoftware/kryo``` by potentially fixing 6 tests, I was lucky that one fix can solve 2 tests, and another can solve 4 tests.

__Ann Chen (hueic2)__
- I created 1 pull requests toward ```google/guava```, but the developer rejected it because FULL mode that reorders the same collection twice is not interesting to them, so I marked it as DeveloperWontFix in IDOFT. I also created 2 PRs in ```apache/accumulo```, which is currently pending.
